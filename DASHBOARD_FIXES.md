# DANN4 Dashboard Fixes - User-Only App

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ **Removed "Total Students" Section**
**Problem**: Dashboard was showing admin-level information (Total Students count) which is inappropriate for a user-only app.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the "Total Students" card from the dashboard layout
- Simplified the statistics section to show only "Registered Courses" count
- Updated layout to use a single centered card instead of two side-by-side cards

**Changes Made**:
- `fragment_dashboard.xml`: Removed the second CardView containing "Total Students"
- `DashboardFragment.java`: Removed StudentViewModel and related student observation code
- Updated text to show "Registered Courses" instead of "Total Courses"

### 2. ✅ **Added "View All" Buttons**
**Problem**: Users couldn't navigate to full lists of announcements and courses from the dashboard.

**Solution**:
- Added "View All" buttons to both Announcements and Recent Courses sections
- Implemented click listeners for navigation to full lists
- Added proper string resources for localization

**Changes Made**:
- Added `tv_view_all_announcements` and `tv_view_all_courses` TextViews
- Implemented click navigation to courses list
- Added string resources in both English and Amharic

### 3. ✅ **Enhanced Click Navigation**
**Problem**: Clicking on announcements and course items didn't navigate anywhere.

**Solution**:
- Added click listeners for "View All" buttons
- Added click listeners for RecyclerView sections
- Implemented proper navigation using Navigation Component

**Navigation Added**:
```java
// Navigate to courses list when clicking "View All" button
binding.tvViewAllCourses.setOnClickListener(v -> 
    Navigation.findNavController(v).navigate(R.id.nav_courses));

// Navigate to courses list when clicking on courses RecyclerView
binding.recyclerRecentCourses.setOnClickListener(v -> 
    Navigation.findNavController(v).navigate(R.id.nav_courses));
```

### 4. ✅ **Improved User Experience**
**Problem**: Dashboard didn't feel personalized or user-friendly.

**Solution**:
- Added personalized welcome message with user's name
- Improved visual hierarchy with better section headers
- Added proper clickable feedback with ripple effects

**UX Improvements**:
- Welcome message now shows actual user name from UserSession
